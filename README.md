Welcome to my Brain teaser game. The aim of the game is to write out the colour's of the words which appears on the screen. You have 60 seconds to get as many points as you can. To begin, press the begin button. Then press on the input bar and type your answers. To increase the difficulty of the game, select the hard or wacky mode by pressing on the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Be quick and try to beat the top score!
